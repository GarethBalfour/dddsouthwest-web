    <h2>How to get to DDD South West</h2>

    <h3>By Train to Bristol Temple Meads station</h3>

Leave the station through the car park - go past the main exit and out the door at the side of the building, across both the indoor &amp; outdoor car parks - &amp; turn left down the hill. You should be able to see the spire of St. Mary Redcliffe Church in the middle distance on the left as you cross the car park. Head for the church, turn left at the large roundabout and go up the hill to the right of the church. The Sixth Form Centre is on the left, opposite the Mercure Holland House hotel.</p>

    <h3>By Bus to Bristol Bus Station</h3>
    <p>Then take bus no. A1 (bay 8 in bus station) to Redcliffe Way (stop Tn). Go up the hill to the right of the church. The Sixth Form Centre is on the left, opposite the Mercure Holland House hotel.</p>
    <p>Or if you want to walk it takes about 20 mins (but it's not a straight-forward route).</p>
